Images are in two formats:
- Stream when comming from camera/gallery and when assigned to UI element
- byte[] in app-wide memory and at backend

The byte[] image is placed directly in the database.

Should probably be changed. Guess as to best solution: 
- database contains references to images that are stored elsewhere in the backend and get individual URLs
- these URLs are used as image sources for UI elements (I think default caching  will be useful)

This would mean that conversion from stream to byte[] is still needed at frontend, but not vice versa

An image may be deleted from the backend in between reference to it being sent to client and its use. Error handling needed.
